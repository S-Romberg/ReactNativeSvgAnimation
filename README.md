# Implementing SVG Color Change on Press using React Native Reanimated

This guide demonstrates how to implement SVG color change on press in a React Native application using the Reanimated library. Follow these steps to enhance user interaction in your mobile app.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   Make sure to install the necessary packages:

   ```bash
   npm install react-native-reanimated
   ```

2. **Set up SVG:**
   Start by incorporating your SVG into the React Native component where you want the color change to occur.

3. **Create Animated Component:**
   Utilize Reanimated to create an animated component for your SVG:

   ```javascript
   const AnimatedPath = Animated.createAnimatedComponent(Path);
   ```

## Implementing Color Change

4. **Path Replacement:**
   Identify the SVG paths you want to animate and replace them with the `AnimatedPath` component.

5. **Adjust Properties:**
   Update the height, width, and fill properties for both Paths and AnimatedPaths. Ensure the AnimatedPath's fill property matches the desired output.

6. **Animation Logic:**
   Integrate the following code to initiate color change based on user interaction:

   ```javascript
   const fillProgress = useSharedValue(userPressed ? 1 : 0);
   const animatedProps = useAnimatedProps(() => {
     const fillValue = interpolateColor(fillProgress.value, [0, 1], ['transparent', 'newColor']);
     return {
       fill: fillValue
     };
   });
   useEffect(() => {
     fillProgress.value = withTiming(userPressed ? 1 : 0, { duration: 500 });
   }, [userPressed]);
   ```

   Adjust parameters to control the animation speed.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you'll successfully implement SVG color change on press using React Native Reanimated. Experiment with different SVGs and enhance the visual appeal of your mobile app.
